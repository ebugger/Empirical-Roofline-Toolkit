The Empirical Roofline Tool, ERT, automatically generates a roofline datafor a given computer. This includes the maximum bandwidth for the
various levels of the memory hierarchy and the maximum gflop rate. This data is obtained using a variety of "micro-kernels".

The ERT comes with a set of configuration files for a number of computers/architectures. These configuration file can be adapted to your
local environment and needs to better measure the roofline parameters of your computer(s).

To find out more about using this tool please read the user's manual, "ERT_Users_Manual.pdf".
